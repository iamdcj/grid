# Track

A track is direction in which items are placed in a grid - a track can be one of the following;

- Row - a set of items running along the x axis.

```
[][][][][]
```

- Column - a set of items running along the y axis.

```
[]
[]
[]
[]
[]
```

## Implicit vs. Explicit

There are two types of tracks, and either track can be either implicit, or explicit.

#### Implicit

The implicit grid is auto-generated by the browse engine, that is the engine will determine if track(s) need to be generated based on styles applied to the container, for example;

The engineer sets the number of columns, but doesn't state the number of rows,

##### CSS

```
grid-template-columns: 20px 20px 20px;
```

the browser will implicitly generate row tracks

##### Rendering

```
[][][]
[][][]
```

because the number of grid items in the container exceeds what is defined for the explicit columns

##### HTML

```
<section class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item>
  <div class="grid-item>
  <div class="grid-item>
  <div class="grid-item>
  <div class="grid-item>
  <div class="grid-item>
</section>
```

The above is an example of explicit column tracks, and implicit row tracks.

### Explicit

If the engineer defines tracks for both the row and the columns, and the number of items fit nicely into the defined grid, the grid will be fully explicit, for example;

There following markup contains four grid items

```
<section class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item>
  <div class="grid-item>
  <div class="grid-item>
  <div class="grid-item>
</section>
```

The styles define two columns, and two rows

```
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 200px;
  grid-template-rows: 200px 200px;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

The result is a fully explcit grid;

```

[][]
